# googlemeet-attendence-alert
This program alerts you and keeps this message (Present mam) in google meet chat box when teacher calls for attendance.

It alerts you in different ways , it messages you in telegram and also it makes beep sound when ever teacher calls you for attendence.

you can shedule the classes, it auto logins your google account and joins in to class at given time and gives attendence for you (when teacher calls you) in chatbox and alerts you in telegram and makes beep sound in computer 

if you want to join a class then you just need to use telegram bot , give this command in telegram bot "login in to this link http://meet.google.com/XXXX" then it logins your google account and joins meet for you. several usefull commands are implemented in telegram bot to implement all the below tasks : exit all google meets , stop notifications  , stop giving messages in google meet chatbox , start notifications , etc...

Just follow comments in the program and fill in the details then run the program using python

I implemented this program just for fun . Don't skip classes by running this program because it may hurt your performance in exams.

If you are a self learner and hates to attend classes and somehow want to get attendence even if you don't listen to class, Then this script is for you!!!
